# FDA-FoodInsights-Unsupervised-Clustering-Topic-Modeling
This project applies unsupervised ML methods—dimensionality reduction(TruncatedSVD, UMAP), K-Means clustering, and NMF-based topic modeling—to uncover patterns in FDA food event data. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization steps that illustrate how unstructured text can be transformed into actionable insights.
